# mouseclicker

This is a java program designed to click when the program "sees" a specific value in a given X-Y position.

The color, (and program in general), was desinged to be used with HumanBenchmark reaction time test.

The "mouse" file was used in order to find what position the mouse is, and the "mousepointer" is what actually runs the clicker. 

Originally I wanted for the program to continously check the area around the mouse so while it moved, it would check to see if the specific rgb value was there and click, but I could not figure it out/took too long for the program to boot.
