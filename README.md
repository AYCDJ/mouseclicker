# mouseclicker

This is a java program designed to click when the program "sees" a specific value in a given X-Y position.

The color, (and program in general), was desinged to be used with HumanBenchmark reaction time test.

The "mouse" file was used in order to find what position the mouse is, and the "mousepointer" is what actually runs the clicker.
